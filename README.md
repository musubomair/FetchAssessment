# Assessment for iOS Apprenticeship at Fetch by Musub Omair

## Tested Using
```XCode v14.3 and Swift 5```

## Description

The assessment includes two screens: 
1. Home
2. DessertDetail

#### Home
```Home consists of a TableView displaying all the desserts fetched from endpoint #1.```

```TableViewCell shows the thumbnail of the dessert along with the dessert name centered with a backdrop view to improve visibility and give an overall more user friendly feel```

#### DessertDetail
```DessertDetail is a screen that displays all the required details of the tapped dessert: its name, instructions and ingredients / measurements.```

```Endpoint #2 was called by passing in the dessert's ID. Nil and empty values for ingredients / measurements were filtered out```

### Unit Tests

## Instructions 

1. Clone
